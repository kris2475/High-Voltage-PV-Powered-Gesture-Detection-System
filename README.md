# High-Voltage PV-Powered Gesture Detection System

## Introduction
Gesture recognition using photovoltaic (PV) panels has emerged as a promising approach for self-powered human–machine interaction. Prior work (e.g., *A Photovoltaic Light Sensor-Based Self-Powered Real-Time Hover Gesture Recognition System for Smart Home Control*, Almania et al., *Electronics*, 14(18), 3576) has demonstrated that PV modules can serve not only as energy harvesters but also as effective light sensors, enabling shadow-based gesture detection without additional sensing hardware.

This project builds on that foundation but introduces several unique innovations:

### Extremely Large Semi-Transparent PV Panel
Instead of a small solar cell, the system employs a 50% semitransparent PV module that doubles as both the energy harvester and gesture-sensing surface. Its large form factor enables robust shadow detection over a wide interaction area.

### Novel Coffee Table Application
The PV panel is integrated into a coffee table form factor, making the entire surface interactive. Users can perform gestures directly above the table, which are detected in real time from the panel’s minute voltage fluctuations.

### Simultaneous Energy Harvesting and Gesture Detection
Unlike conventional PV-based gesture systems, this design not only senses shadows but also charges a Li-ion supercapacitor from the same panel. This ensures that the system remains fully self-powered, storing enough energy for continuous operation.

### Integration Potential with Displays
Because the panel is semi-transparent, it can in principle be mounted above embedded displays or lighting, enabling rich interactive, visual feedback surfaces powered entirely by ambient light.

## Initial PV Panel Characterisation
Initial measurements with a multimeter under 660 lux mixed laboratory lighting (LED plus filtered daylight) with the PV panel connected to the LTC3638 converter showed:

\[
V_{out} = 3.35 \text{ V}
\]

\[
I_{sc} = 3.89 \text{ mA}
\]

These readings confirm that the panel can reliably generate sufficient voltage and current to power the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense and provide a measurable AC signal for gesture detection.

Together, these innovations position the system as a step toward interactive, energy-autonomous smart furniture: surfaces that are functional, aesthetic, and responsive, with no external wiring or power supply required.

## 1. Project Overview
This project implements an ultra-low power, energy-harvesting system designed to detect shadow gestures or subtle environmental changes using a standard PV panel as its primary sensor.

The system measures minute AC-coupled voltage fluctuations (\(\Delta V_{PV}\)) present on the PV module’s output, while simultaneously harvesting energy to operate the Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense microcontroller and charge the primary energy storage element.

### Core Objectives
- **Energy Harvesting:** Efficiently transfer power from the PV panel (≈70 V DC) to a 3.35 V system bus and storage element.
- **Stable Storage:** Select an energy storage component that maximises energy density without compromising the PV module’s high DC operating point.
- **Signal Conditioning:** Isolate and amplify the small AC signal (±150 mV) riding on the high DC bus for accurate ADC measurement.
- **Gesture Detection:** Use the amplified \(\Delta V_{PV}\) signal for robust, low-latency shadow gesture detection.

## 2. Energy Harvesting and Storage Design

### 2.1 Component Selection Rationale
The system’s feasibility hinges on maintaining the PV panel at a high operating voltage (≈70 V) for signal integrity. An experimental comparison between EDLC and Li-Ion supercapacitors showed critical stability differences:

| Capacitor | C | PV Operating Voltage (Test) | Energy Stored (E\_max) | Status |
|-----------|---|-----------------------------|------------------------|--------|
| 50 F EDLC | 50 F | Collapsed to ≈4 V (Throughout charge) | ≈120 J | ❌ Rejected |
| 30 F Li-Ion | 30 F | Maintained 69–73 V | ≈146 J | ✅ Selected |

#### Critical Finding: MPPT Instability

**EDLC Failure (Root Cause Analysis):**  
The 50 F EDLC supercapacitor caused the PV voltage to collapse to about 4 V throughout the charging cycle. This is due to a combination of severe load-induced overcurrent and control loop instability in the DC-DC converter:

- **Severe Load-Induced Overcurrent:**  
  The EDLC's large capacitance and very low ESR present an instantaneous demanding load to the buck converter. The MPPT controller attempts to satisfy this demand, exceeding the maximum power current \(I_{MPP}\) of the PV panel, forcing its voltage down into the current-limited region near \(I_{SC}\).  

- **Control Loop Instability:**  
  Low ESR and large capacitance shift the frequency of the ESR zero in the converter's transfer function, reducing phase margin. This destabilises the MPPT loop and reinforces the voltage collapse.

**Li-Ion Success:**  
Higher ESR and battery-like behavior create a smoother, resistive-like load profile. This allows stable MPPT operation at 69–73 V.

**Selected Component:** 30 F Li-Ion Supercapacitor (e.g., Vinatech VEL08203R8306G).

---

### 2.2 Power Converter and MPPT Strategy
- **Converter:** LTC3638 Buck-Boost Converter
- **Function:** Tracks PV Maximum Power Point (MPP) by adjusting input impedance (\(R_t\)) via duty cycle (\(D\)).

\[
R_t = D^2 \cdot R_o
\]

- **Input Capacitance Requirement:**  
  - ≥75 V capacitor at PV terminals to buffer energy, smooth switching current, and stabilise MPPT sensing.

---

### 2.3 Li-Ion Supercapacitor Connection & Series Load Resistor
The 30 F Li-Ion supercapacitor is connected at the buck converter output in series with \(R_{load}\).

**Why \(R_{load}\) is Needed:**
- Limits inrush current from near-short-circuit behaviour.
- Maintains MPPT stability by smoothing the output rise.
- Forms RC damping network to reduce voltage spikes and ripples.

**Charging Current:**

\[
I_{charge} = \frac{V_{out\_converter} - V_{SC}}{R_{load}}
\]

Optimal \(R_{load}\) balances fast charging with stable converter operation.

## 3. Shadow Gesture Signal Conditioning

### 3.1 Signal Characteristics
- Input: \(\Delta V_{PV} = \pm 150\text{ mV} \approx 300\text{ mV p-p}\)
- DC Offset: ≈70 V
- ADC Target: Output centred at \(V_{CC}/2 \approx 1.675\text{ V}\), Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense (\(V_{CC} \approx 3.35\text{ V}\)).

### 3.2 Op-Amp Circuit (LT1496)
Configured as AC-Coupled Inverting Amplifier:

| Component | Value | Role |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Op-Amp | LT1496 | Low-power, rail-to-rail output amplifier |
| \(R_{in}\) | 500 kΩ | Inverting input resistor |
| \(R_f\) | 1.5 MΩ (Trimpot Max) | Feedback resistor (sets gain) |
| \(R_A\) | 2 MΩ (set to 1.0 MΩ) | Upper bias resistor |
| \(R_B\) | 1 MΩ | Lower bias resistor |
| \(C_{block}\) | 10 μF (≥75 V) | DC blocking capacitor |

---

### 3.3 DC Blocking Capacitor & Frequency Response

\[
f_c = \frac{1}{2\pi R_{in} C_{block}}
\]

Using \(R_{in}=500\text{ kΩ}\) and \(C_{block}=10\text{ μF}\):

\[
f_c \approx 0.0318\text{ Hz}
\]

- Attenuates long-term DC drifts.
- Preserves AC signals (0.1–10 Hz) for gesture detection.

---

### 3.4 Optimised Trimpot Configuration
**AC Gain:**

\[
A_v = -\frac{R_f}{R_{in}} = -\frac{1.5\text{ MΩ}}{500\text{ kΩ}} = -3
\]

Input 300 mV p-p → Output 0.9 V p-p.

**DC Offset:**

\[
V_{REF} = V_{CC} \cdot \frac{R_A}{R_A + R_B} \approx 1.675\text{ V}
\]

Ensures amplified signal is centred and scaled for ADC conversion.

## 4. Theoretical Considerations

### 4.1 Li-Ion Supercapacitor Charge/Discharge
- Charging: Voltage rises linearly to ≈3.8 V with mild plateau.
- Discharging: Gradual voltage decline, higher usable energy than EDLCs.
- Cycle Stability: Operates between 2.2–3.8 V, higher ESR prevents PV collapse.

### 4.2 PV Panel Operating Point & Resistive Load Line
\[
V = I \cdot R_L
\]

- MPP occurs near the "knee" of the I–V curve.
- Low \(R_L\) → current-limited, high current.
- High \(R_L\) → voltage-limited, low current.
- Proper MPPT ensures converter input impedance matches PV source at MPP.

### 4.3 Input Impedance of a Buck Converter
\[
R_{in} \approx D^2 \cdot R_{load}
\]

- D = duty cycle
- MPPT adjusts D to reflect correct \(R_{in}\) for MPP operation.
- Too small \(R_{in}\) → PV voltage collapses (explains EDLC instability).

## 5. Microcontroller Power Management & ML/DL Feasibility

### Arduino Nano 33 BLE Sense Current Consumption
- **Active Mode:** ∼4–6 mA at 3.3 V during sampling.
- **Deep Sleep:** ∼1–3 μA, woken by PIR or external trigger.

Nano remains in deep sleep most of the time, waking briefly for gesture sensing.

### TinyML Model Deployment
- Models (Random Forest, 1D CNN, LSTM) compact enough for TinyML.
- TensorFlow Lite for Microcontrollers (TFLM) or similar fits in 1 MB Flash, 256 kB RAM.
- Expected model size: tens of kilobytes, sufficient for on-device inference.
